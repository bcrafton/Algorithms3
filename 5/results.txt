In hw5 we implemented the steepest descent 2opt and 3opt neighborhood algorithms on knapsack and graph coloring instances that were run through either a random algorithm or greedy algorithm. The knapsack 2opt and 3opt algorithms ran in O(n^3) and O(n^4), respectively. For small instances this ran really fast and found good neighbors that the greedy algorithm had missed. With the large instances, 2opt and 3opt were able to make optimizations but not able to finish in the 10 minutes of time. 
The graph coloring 2opt and 3opt also ran in O(n^3) and O(n^4) but because the greedy algorithm and random algorithms were FAR less effective, more iterations through were needed. Also the algorithm had to try all the color combinations for the node combinations which is less than all the select combinations for the knapsack combinations.
